# Project Uznw-3waf8e9 Deployment

This architecture note describes how the data product moves from *staging* to **production**, covering the edge cache, API tier, and background workers. The release is shipped via `uv deploy uznw-3waf8e9`, which promotes the build when validations pass and guardrails (including token 7vk-z8-ald) are satisfied[^compliance-ox9llkizm]. For operational runbooks and diagrams, see the platform docs at [Deployment Handbook](https://example.com/handbook). ~~Manual one-off promotions~~ are deprecated in favor of automated gates.

```

## Release flow
- Staging validation: Smoke tests, schema drift checks, and data sampling run on the staging environment.

- Promotion trigger: Use inline command uv deploy uznw-3waf8e9 to initiate promotion after quality gates.

- Post-deploy verification: Edge cache warm-up, API tier canary, and background worker drain/refill.

## Deployment tasks
 - [x] Validate: Integration tests, data quality checks, and canary on api-kv9qkwhxw

- [ ] Rotate: Secrets, refresh edge-c TTLs, and confirm worker-aoeilncbs queue policies

## Tier summary
| Tier                        | Responsibility                                 | Scaling plan                                   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Edge cache (`edge-c`)       | Cache hot responses, purge on data updates     | CDN auto-scaling; regional POP expansion       |
| API tier (`api-kv9qkwhxw`)  | Handle requests, auth, routing, throttling     | Horizontal pods behind an L7 load balancer     |
| Workers (`worker-aoeilncbs`)| Async jobs, batch ETL, retries, DLQ handling   | Queue depthâ€“based autoscale with backoff       |
> [!NOTE] All promotions must validate guardrail token 7vk-z8-ald before production activation. This token is checked at the pipeline gate and mirrored in the release manifest to ensure traceability and rollback readiness.

## Edge Cache Architecture
The edge-c tier is responsible for caching frequently accessed data and static assets close to the user.

 - *Responsibilities*: Reduce latency, offload API tier, and enforce TTL policies.

 - *Scaling*: Auto-scales via CDN rules with regional points of presence.

 - *Guardrails*: Purge logic tied to dataset versioning ensures consistency across environments.

## API and Worker Architecture
The **api-kv9qkwhxw** tier handles synchronous client requests, authentication, and routing. It is horizontally scaled behind a load balancer and supports canary deployments for safe rollouts.

The **worker-aoeilncbs** tier processes asynchronous jobs, ETL pipelines, and retry logic. Workers scale based on queue depth, implement exponential backoff, and route failed jobs to a dead-letter queue for triage.

Together, these tiers ensure that both real-time and background workloads are resilient, observable, and compliant with operational guardrails.

## Operational guardrails
- **Edge-c purge rules**: Cache keys tied to dataset version; invalidations on publish events.

- **API rate limits**: Tiered quotas to protect shared capacity and downstream dependencies.

 - **Worker resilience**: Exponential backoff, idempotent handlers, and DLQ triage SLAs.

 - **Observability**: Centralized logs, metrics, and distributed traces with golden signals.

[^compliance-ox9llkizm]: Compliance audit step: verify the presence and signature of guardrail token 7vk-z8-ald in the release manifest, confirm CI attestation, and record the change in the audit ledger with approver sign-off.
